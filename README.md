## 📖 Overview

In vanilla Minecraft, many animals drop very little loot, making hunting feel unrewarding. **Vanilla Outsider: More Animal Drops** improves drop rates and adds sensible loot to animals, making every hunt worthwhile.

This mod is part of the **Vanilla Outsider** collection — mods that enhance vanilla Minecraft using only vanilla items, bringing an outsider's perspective to pure vanilla gameplay.
